# Content editing

![unknown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/28792395-c1b74594-762f-11e7-8ff6-b49586f39360.jpeg)

Most content on the site can be edited on GitHub without messing with HTML markup.

The site's source and structure is in the [`_src/`](_src) folder. Ignore everything with an underscore in its name.

When viewing a file on GitHub you will see a small pencil icon in the top right. Click that to edit the file.

## Pages

All pages are simple Markdown files. Markdown is a way of telling the site how an element should be marked up, like headings & bold text:

```markdown
I'm a simple paragraph. No fancy symbols needed.

# I'm a heading 1
## I'm a heading 2

You can make text **bold like so**
```

Have a look at [Code of Conduct](_src/code-of-conduct.md) or the [Imprint](_src/imprint.md) to see how Markdown is used.

## Special pages

Some pages like front page & speakers page source their content dynamically during site build. This is so we have a single source of truth for content used in multiple places on the site.

### Front page

Content for all sections on front page is coming from a data file:
- [`_src/_data/content-front.yml`](_src/_data/content-front.yml)

## Speakers & Talks

All speakers data is coming from individual speaker files in [`_src/_speakers`](_src/_speakers)

### Adding / editing speakers & talks

Each content item is represented as a Markdown file with YAML at the top. The data should look something like this:

```
---
property: "value"
other_property:
    - "list"
    - "of"
    - "values"
---
```

### Add new content through GitHub

1. Click into the appropriate directory ([/_src/_speakers](_src/_speakers), [/_src/_talks](_src/_talks)
1. Copy the data from an existing `.md` file
1. In the parent folder, click `Create new file`
1. Paste the data into GitHub and edit
1. Edit to your heartâ€™s content!
 - The filename you choose may determine the content page URL
 - The `id` property should be the same as the filename
1. When finished, fill in a commit description and select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`.
1. Wait to see if the created pull request passes the build. If it does, click merge and your changes will be live

# Development

![200](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/28792559-56cbe02c-7630-11e7-851f-40192e0ce50a.gif)

You need to have the following tools installed on your development machine before moving on:

- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) & [npm](https://npmjs.org/)
- (optional) use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) instead of npm for faster dependency installations
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) (for sanity, install with [rvm](https://rvm.io/))
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

## Install dependencies

Run the following command from the repository's root folder to install all dependencies.

```bash
npm i && bundle install
```

or

```bash
yarn && bundle install
```

## Development build

Spin up local dev server and livereloading watch task, reachable under [https://localhost:1337](https://localhost:1337):

```bash
gulp
```

# Continuous deployment: always be shipping

![shipping](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/90316/26559768/e21e9724-44b1-11e7-90cf-6ef6ebb06d09.gif)

The site gets built & deployed automatically via Travis. This is the preferred way of deployment, it makes sure the site is always deployed with fresh dependencies and only after a successful build.

Build & deployment happens under the following conditions on Travis:

- every push builds the site
- **live deployment**: every push to the master branch initiates a live deployment
- **beta deployment**: every new pull request and every subsequent push to it initiates a beta deployment

# Manual deployment

For emergency live deployments or beta & gamma deployments, the manual method can be used. The site is hosted in an S3 bucket and gets deployed via a gulp task.

## Prerequisite: authentication

To deploy the site, you must authenticate yourself against the AWS API with your AWS credentials. Get your AWS access key and secret and add them to `~/.aws/credentials`:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

This is all that is needed to authenticate with AWS if you've setup your credentials as the default profile.

If you've set them up as another profile, say `[9984]` you can grab those credentials by using the `AWS_PROFILE` variable like so:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=9984 gulp deploy --live
```

In case that you get authentication errors or need an alternative way to authenticate with AWS, check out the [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html).

## Staging build & beta deployment

The staging build is a full production build but prevents search engine indexing & Google Analytics tracking.

```bash
# make sure your local npm packages & gems are up to date
npm update && bundle update

# make staging build in /_dist
# build preventing search engine indexing & Google Analytics tracking
gulp build --staging

# deploy contents of /_dist to beta
gulp deploy --beta
```

## Production build & live deployment

```bash
# make sure your local npm packages & gems are up to date
npm update && bundle update

# make production build in /_dist
gulp build --production

# deploy contents of /_dist to live
gulp deploy --live
```

Lint with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io) in your editor or run:

```bash
npm test
