Having a special focus in the music business, he seeks to create a blockchain-based standard for music metadata and licensing and has collaborated with numerous musicians, from struggling artists to mid-level bands and even a few platinum-selling superstars.

Finding available web and music publishing platforms lacking, Peterâ€™s combination of background and insight is what led to the fundamental features offered via Resonate, a cooperatively owned streaming music service.
