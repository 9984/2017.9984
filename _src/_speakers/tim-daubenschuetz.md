 First getting involved in 2013, his contributions to the blockchain space focus around intellectual property, self-sovereign data and identity. He has devoted his career to work on the core technology underpinning blockchain. Tim joined ascribe.io as a full-stack developer, spent the better half of 2015 figuring out how to map intellectual property rights into immutable ledgers with COALA IP, before ultimately taking on the role of product management at BigchainDB.
