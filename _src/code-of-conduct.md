## The Quick Version

Our summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free summit experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of summit participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any summit venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Summit participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the summit without a refund at the discretion of the summit organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the summit organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the summit with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of summit staff immediately. Summit staff can be identified as theyâ€™ll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.

Summit staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the summit. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at summit and workshop venues and summit-related social events.
