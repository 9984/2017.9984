title: "Real-World Scenarios Using BigchainDB and Tymlez"
---

This talk will focus on some real-world scenarios using BigchainDB at clients ranging from the Netherlandsâ€™ central purchasing agency for local governments (CIB) securing the content of immigration visas, to the Dutch Ministry of Transportation (ILT) leveraging a document sharing app combined with smart contracts capabilities, and a UK-based accounting firm (Grant Thornton) automating audit processes by combing document sharing functionality with smart contracts to approve and process payments.
