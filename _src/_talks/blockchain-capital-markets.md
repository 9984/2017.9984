Blockchain technology will change the future of capital markets by allowing for a “one stop shop” for traditional financial securities. This means the entire lifecycle of blockchain-based digital assets, including origination, issuance, exchange, settlement and redemption could become a much more efficient market.

Using blockchain or distributed ledger technology, asset creation may be easier than ever. Using smart contracts, business logic, digital identity and digital signatures allows for a much shorter time to market for potentially a fraction of the cost.
