Capitalism runs on imperfect information. When an object is traded its entire context is reduced to price. Blockchains could allow for richer value representations including the history of an object, its scientific composition and its embedded externalities like CO2 emissions or bad labor practices.

But just because we could make the world a better place with transparency doesn't mean we will choose to do so. Will basic economics drive a transparent world, or will it stay more profitable to trade in obscurity?
