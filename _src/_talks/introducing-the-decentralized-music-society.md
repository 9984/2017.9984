title: "Introducing the Decentralized Music Society"
---

The purpose of the Decentralized Music Society (DMS) is to create a decentralized machine-readable database of directly licensable artist-controlled works. In this manner, DMS believes a healthier and sustainable music industry will emerge via the participation of existing industries and entrepreneurs who have heretofore been unable to utilize music in their products. This talk will explain the rationale of the DMS and provide an update on its progress.
