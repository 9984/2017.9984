Blockchain technology promises a new wave of disruptive technological innovation. We can look forward to positive impacts, but as we have seen in the past two years, disruption is not always a good thing. It can also threaten what we thought was a stable foundation for liberal democracy.

Our panelists discuss their biggest hopes and fears for a society built on blockchain technology. How can blockchain technology help reform our society? What areas should be disrupted, and what disruptions should be guarded against?
