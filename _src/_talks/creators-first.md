title: "Creators First: A Journey from ascribe to IPDB"
---

This talk is the story of how ascribe got started focusing on helping artists feed their families and how that work evolved into a web-scale image search (whereonthe.net), a scalable blockchain database (BigchainDB), a public network (IPDB) and an IP protocol (COALA IP) -- always with creators first.
