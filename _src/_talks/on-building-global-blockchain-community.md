title: "On Building Global Blockchain Community: The Human Coordination Layer of the Decentralized Stack"
---

Blockchains offer the promise and peril of large-scale economic and social coordination, in unprecedented ways, across domains, verticals and geographies, that are driven by new social values and constrained only by the limits of imagination. However, the traditional hierarchies and frameworks that comprise the nervous systems of centralized global institutions, for all their weaknesses, serve essential functions for coordination and collaboration. How do we fulfill these essential functions in the decentralized space, with new entrants and exciting initiatives rapidly emerging from around the globe every day, that raise complex and novel issues across markets and the law? How do we ensure that fact-based research rather than special interests drives global development around blockchain? What structures and practices do we need for the many disparate participants in the decentralized community to coordinate and collaboratively address critical ecosystem-wide issues around interoperability, law and regulation, social policy, and the development of healthy norms? How can we together define a new game with these new tools, rather than playing the old game? A short introduction to the COALA community and ideas for how to foster a decentralized community that enables global coordination and collaboration for the spectrum of key issues that will define this brave new world.
