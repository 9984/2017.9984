title: Digital Human Rights - The Right to Encryption and Self-Sovereign Data
---

The advent of mass market computers and the internet created a new operating system for a digital era. Given the rising amount of public data about our day to day interactions, it might be time to redefine the human right charter and adjust it to the realities of the data driven world powered by AI, blockchain and IoT. 

Are we post-privacy or do we need to redefine the notion of privacy in the digital age? Should encryption be a constitutional right or do we want to keep criminalizing encryption as has been the attempt of many government post 9/11? Do we need to protect centrally stored files or can we use the new technology around blockchain and web3 to create proactive privacy by design?
