title: "Resilient Identity Services"
---

Blockchain based identity services are highly innovative regarding their cryptographic algorithms. They are secure from the software perspective. The hardware they are operated on are less so – if at all – considered. Therefore RIDDLE&CODE is currently developing a server solution based on hardware secure modules, AES encrypting solid state disks, dedicated virtual machines for code execution in trusted environments, NFC for secure key exchange and software defined radios for staying always and everywhere connected. This talk will present a short progress report about the ongoing project, its challenges and possibilities.
